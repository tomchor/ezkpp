Introduction
============

This is an unofficial guide is aimed at providing additional information not
covered by the official KPP manual. We focus on the latest version of the
software, release 2.2.3, which can be freely downloaded at its `official
webpage <http://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/>`_. 

The source for the documentation can be found at its `github page
<https://github.com/tomchor/ezkpp>`_ and the online html version can be
accessed `here <https://tomchor.github.io/ezkpp/>`_.

We recommend any person reading this guide to keep a copy of the original
manual (which can be downloaded `here
<http://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/>`_) since this guide is not
meant to replace the original manual, but to supplement it.
