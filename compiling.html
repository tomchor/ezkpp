<h1>Compiling KPP<a class="headerlink" href="#compiling-kpp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we detail how to successfully download and compile KPP
on your system under the Bash environment.</p>
<div class="section" id="downloading-into-your-folder">
<h2>Downloading into your folder<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-into-your-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the first things to be said is: most of the commands we will use will
only work if you&#8217;re in the right directory (which we will always tell what it
is). So when you open a terminal, that terminal is &#8220;running&#8221; in some directory
in your computer.  You can find out which directory that is by entering the
command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></code> which stands for &#8220;Print Working Directory&#8221;. That will show you
exactly where you are on your computer.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You can also use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> command, which will &#8220;list&#8221; everything you have on
that directory to get a better sense of where you are. Also, you can use the
command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tree</span> <span class="pre">-d</span> <span class="pre">`pwd`</span></code>, which shows you your current directory on top, and
the subdirectories in it in a tree-like structure. Try it! This can also be used
to make you get a sense of where you are and what directories are &#8220;around you&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<p>To change directories, you can
use the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></code>, which stands for &#8220;Change Directory&#8221;. So if you want to
go to your downloads directory, you can type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">Downloads</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span>
<span class="pre">/home/myuser/Downloads</span></code> depending on where you are on your terminal (the first
is a relative path (to your current location) and the second is an absolute or
full path; you can read more about relative and absolute paths <a class="reference external" href="https://jeremywsherman.com/blog/2011/09/26/absolute-and-relative-paths/">here</a>).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Throughout this document, we&#8217;ll generally use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myuser</span></code> to refer to
your username in the system. This generally comes right after <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/</span></code>
and you should change according to your case. So if your user name is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">john</span></code>
you&#8217;d replace <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/myuser</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/john</span></code> in every occasion.</p>
</div>
<p>If you prefer to download KPP through its website manually and unpack it
somewhere, you&#8217;ll have to go there with your terminal. So, if I unpack it in my
home directory, as soon as I open my terminal I&#8217;ll have to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span>
<span class="pre">/home/myuser/kpp-2.2.3</span></code>. This command will only work if the path is correct (it
might not work on Windows, for example, which does not have a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home</span></code> location.
If you&#8217;re using Bash on Windows it&#8217;s better to go with the following
alternative.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re insecure with navigating your directories using your
terminal, it&#8217;s best to do everything via this second, more straightfoward,
option. It uses solely commands but it&#8217;s easier. First, as soon as you open the
terminal run the following commands</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wget http://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/Download/kpp-2.2.3_Nov.2012.zip
unzip kpp-2.2.3_Nov.2012.zip
<span class="nb">cd</span> kpp-2.2.3
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Line one will automatically download the software to your current directory and
line two will unpack it.  This will create a new directory with all the
contants of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.zip</span></code> file, so the last command line will move to the
recently-created directory.</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;re in the correct directory by entering <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></code>, which should show
you that you&#8217;re on the <cite>kpp-2.2.3</cite> directory. You can also type <cite>ls</cite>, which should
show you a list of everything that was in the zip file:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cflags</span>        <span class="n">drv</span>       <span class="nb">int</span>                 <span class="n">Makefile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">defs</span>  <span class="n">site</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">lisp</span>

<div class="section" id="making-sure-dependecies-are-installed">
<h2>Making sure dependecies are installed<a class="headerlink" href="#making-sure-dependecies-are-installed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we are going to set-up the environment to compile KPP. The first step is to
make sure that you have the necessary software. These are called the
dependencies of a program: it is everything the program needs to be available
in the system (softwares, libraries, etc.) before it&#8217;s installed.</p>
<p>Be sure that FLEX (which is a public domain <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">lexical analizer</a>) is installed on your
machine. You can run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex</span> <span class="pre">--version</span></code> and if it is installed you should see
something like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex</span> <span class="pre">2.6.0</span></code>. If instead you see something like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex:</span>
<span class="pre">command</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">found</span></code> then it means that it is not installed and you&#8217;re going to
have to install it by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span> <span class="pre">apt</span> <span class="pre">update</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="pre">sudo</span> <span class="pre">apt</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">flex</span></code> if
you&#8217;re running Linux natively (depending on your Linux distribution) or by
manually installing downloading and installing the file if you&#8217;re emulating
(with Cygwin, for example). A quick google search should tell you how to
install it easily. Note: if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex</span></code> isn&#8217;t available for you, you might need to
install the Flex-dev package with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span> <span class="pre">apt</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">flex-devel.x86_64</span></code>.</p>
<p>Be also sure that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">yacc</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sed</span></code> are installed by typing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">yacc</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">sed</span></code>. If you see something like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/sed</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/yacc</span></code> then they are installed. If you see an error message, then
you&#8217;re also going to have to install it manually. Again, a quick google search
should tell you how to do it, although it is very rare that these packages
aren&#8217;t installed.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flex</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">yacc</span></code> have to do with <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">lexical analysis</a>
and it&#8217;s not specially important to know exactly what they do. Suffices to
say that they are used internally by the compiler to generate the executable
file, but you will never have to use them directly when compiling/using KPP.
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sed</span></code>, however, is a very useful <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">text manipulation tool</a>,
but you also won&#8217;t need to use it
while running KPP.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="telling-your-system-where-kpp-is">
<h2>Telling your system where KPP is<a class="headerlink" href="#telling-your-system-where-kpp-is" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have the dependecies installed, we need to make sure that your
computer knows where KPP is in your system. We do that by altering a file
called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bashrc</span></code>. This file is a simple text file (so can you easily open and
read it, as you&#8217;ll see) with some very simple commands. Every time you start a
terminal that file is &#8220;read&#8221; internally by the terminal and executed. So inside
that file you can put any command that you could type in the terminal. Thus,
generally, if you want to change something in your terminal so that the change
takes place every time you start it (so you don&#8217;t have to re-change it over and
over again every time you open it), that&#8217;s the place to do it. For our purposes
we simply need to add a couple of lines. We&#8217;ll do that step by step.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you&#8217;re using a terminal other than Bash the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bashrc</span></code> file will probably
have a slightly different name (like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.cshrc</span></code> e.g.) and the commands might
also differ a bit, but the process and the ideas are the same! You&#8217;ll just have
to probably do some quick googling.</p>
</div>
<p>First, in the directory where you unpacked KPP, run the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></code> to
print the present working directory and copy its output. You&#8217;ll need this for
the next steps.</p>
<p>Now you need to open and edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bashrc</span></code> which can be done with many programs,
it really depends on what is installed for your (or what you would like to
install).  The best options would be an editor that runs with a GUI. For
Windows users the best option is probably <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">notepad++</span></code>, while for Linux users
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gedit</span></code> is generally the default GUI option. You can try these (and any other
GUI plain text editors you know) with the commands <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gedit</span> <span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></code>, or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">notepad++</span> <span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></code> and so forth with the others.</p>
<p>If any of those work, great!, you can edit the file in an intuitive GUI editor.
If not, you&#8217;re either going to have to install a GUI text editor, or use Nano
by running the command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nano</span> <span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></code>. Nano is a very handy text editor
which runs on the terminal itself, however, it&#8217;s not as eye-pleasing and not as
intuitive as the GUI-based ones.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="nano-ex"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/nano_example.png"><img alt="Example of .bashrc file opened with Nano" src="_images/nano_example.png" style="width: 716.4px; height: 463.5px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">.bashrc example.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If you&#8217;re forced to use Nano, you should probably read this very quick
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/">tutorial</a>
to learn how to open, save and close files. It&#8217;s not as intuitive, but it&#8217;s
very easy.</p>
<p>Once you open <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bashrc</span></code>, you&#8217;re going to see something like Fig.
<a class="reference internal" href="#nano-ex"><span class="std std-ref">.bashrc example.</span></a> (in this case open with Nano). Don&#8217;t worry about the lines of
code. They&#8217;re probably going to be different for you and that&#8217;s OK; it really
varies a lot from system to system. You can ignore all those codes and jump to
the last line of the file. After the last line you&#8217;ll include the following</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">KPP_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/kpp-2.2.3
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:<span class="nv">$KPP_HOME</span>/bin
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>except that you should replace <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$HOME/kpp</span></code> with the output of your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></code> command.
For example, if the output of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwd</span></code> was <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/myuser/Downloads/kpp-2.2.3</span></code> you
should write</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">KPP_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/home/user/Downloads/kpp-2.2.3
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:<span class="nv">$KPP_HOME</span>/bin
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After this is done, you are going to save and exit. If you&#8217;re using any option
with a GUI this should be straightforward. With Nano you can save and exit by
pressing control X, choosing the &#8220;yes&#8221; option (by hitting the &#8220;y&#8221; key) when it
asks you to save, and then pressing enter when asked to confirm to name of the
file to save to.</p>
<p>Now your terminal will know where KPP is the next times you start it. But for
the changes to make effect you need to close this terminal and open another
one. So just close the terminal you were working with, open a new one. Now, if
everything worked properly, you should be able to type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">$KPP_HOME</span></code> and go
automatically to your KPP directory. If this worked, we are ready for the next
step, which is telling your system how to compile KPP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specifying-how-to-compile">
<h2>Specifying how to compile<a class="headerlink" href="#specifying-how-to-compile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we actually compile (which is a way of installing) KPP. First, type
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">locate</span> <span class="pre">libfl.a</span></code> and save the output. If there is no output, use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">locate</span>
<span class="pre">libfl.sh</span></code> and save the output of that. These commands tell you where the Flex
library is, which we assured was installed somewhere in the system during the
last section. In my case the output was <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfl.a</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now in your KPP directory, use the same text editor as before to open a file
called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Makefile.defs</span></code>, which sets how Bash is going to make the executable
code for KPP (i.e., it only gives instructions to your computer on how to
compile it). So type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gedit</span> <span class="pre">Makefile.defs</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nano</span> <span class="pre">Makefile.defs</span></code> and so
on, depending on the editor you&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>Once again, you&#8217;ll see a lot of lines with comments, and the only lines that
matter are those that don&#8217;t start with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></code>. There should be 5 lines like this
in this file. The first one starts with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>, which sets the C Compiler. In
this guide we will use the Gnu Compiler Collection, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gcc</span></code>. So make sure that
the line which starts with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CC</span></code> reads <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CC=gcc</span></code>.</p>
<p>Next, since we made sure that Flex was installed, make sure the next important
line reads <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FLEX=flex</span></code>. On the third step, set the next variable
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FLEX_LIB_DIR</span></code>) with the output we just saved without the last part. So in
my case the output saved was <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfl.a</span></code>, so the line
will read <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FLEX_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</span></code>. You should, of course,
replace your line accordingly.</p>
<p>The next two items define some possible extra options for the compilation and
extra directories also to include in the compilation. We will don&#8217;t have to
worry about those, unless maybe if we need to debug the program for some
reason. Now you can save and close/exit the file.</p>
<p>If we did everything correctly we can compile KPP simply by running the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make</span></code> command. Many warnings are going to appear on the screen (that&#8217;s
normal), but as long as no error appears, the compilation will be successful.
You can be sure it was successsful by once again running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> and seeing that
there is now one extra entry on the KPP directory called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bin           doc       gpl                 Makefile       readme     util
cflags        drv       int                 Makefile.defs  site-lisp
cflags.guess  examples  int.modified_WCOPY  models         src
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now let&#8217;s test it by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpp</span> <span class="pre">test</span></code>. If the output is something like</p>
<div class="code highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">This</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">KPP</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">2.2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mf">3.</span>

<span class="n">KPP</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">parsing</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">equation</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span>
<span class="n">Fatal</span> <span class="n">error</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">File</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">found</span>
<span class="n">Program</span> <span class="n">aborted</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then we know it worked. This tells you the version of KPP and that it couldn&#8217;t
find any file to work with, which is fine because we didn&#8217;t give it any yet. If
this works, you can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>If, however you get an output similar to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpp:</span> <span class="pre">command</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">found...</span></code> then
chances are that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code> is a binary executable file, while it should be a
directory containing the binary file. This should not happen, according to the
manual, but for some reason it (very) often does. We need simply to rename that
executable file and put it a directory called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bin</span></code>. This can be done with
the followinf command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mv bin kpp <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> mkdir bin <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> mv kpp bin
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Try this command and then try <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kpp</span> <span class="pre">test</span></code> again. You should get the correct
output this time, meaning that the system could find KPP successfully.
